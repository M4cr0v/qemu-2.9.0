This directory contains sources for a kvm test suite.

To create the test images do
  ./configure
  make
in this directory. Test images are created in ./<ARCH>/*.flat

Then use the runner script to detect the correct invocation and
invoke the test, e.g.
  ./x86-run ./x86/msr.flat
or
  ./run_tests.sh
to run them all.

To select a specific qemu binary, specify the QEMU=<path>
environment variable, e.g.
  QEMU=/tmp/qemu/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 ./x86-run ./x86/msr.flat

Directory structure:
.:		configure script, top-level Makefile, and run_tests.sh
./config:	collection of architecture dependent makefiles
./docs:		documentation files
./lib:		general architecture neutral services for the tests
./lib/<ARCH>:	architecture dependent services for the tests
./<ARCH>:	the sources of the tests and the created objects/images

See <ARCH>/README for architecture specific documentation.
